<h1 align="center">Peer2Dungeon</h1>

Welcome to Peer2Dungeon, a multiplayer ascii game built on a [P2P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) architecture where each peer can have the following modules:
- Player, who can view and move around the rooms.
- Room, where the player plays.
- Admin, who contains the initial room and knows the rooms with available connections.

To start playing you only need an active room and a player, which you can do through the Makefiles that are in each module.
